"""Experiment 5: Cross-Puzzle Generalization Test.

This experiment tests whether a model trained on one puzzle can generalize
to predict piece positions on a completely different puzzle.

Key question: Did the model learn transferable visual features, or just
memorize the training puzzle's texture-to-position mapping?
