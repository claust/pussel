"""Experiment 10: Add rotation prediction to position prediction.

This experiment builds on exp9's fine-tuned backbone architecture,
adding a rotation prediction head (4-class: 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees)
alongside the existing position prediction.

Phase 3 of the coarse regression approach - multi-task learning.
