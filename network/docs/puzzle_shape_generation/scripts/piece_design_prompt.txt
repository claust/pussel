Background

  We are generating synthetic puzzle piece shapes using 6 cubic Bézier curves per tab/blank edge. The goal is to produce realistic puzzle piece outlines that closely match real puzzle pieces for use in computer vision training data.

  Current Parameters (10 per tab/blank)

  - neck_width: Width of the narrow waist (current bounds: 0.12-0.25)
  - bulb_width: Width of the bulb head (current bounds: 0.25-0.45)
  - height: How far the tab protrudes (current bounds: 0.15-0.40)
  - position: Where along edge the tab is centered (typical: 0.35-0.65)
  - neck_ratio: Height of waist as proportion of total height (typical: 0.15-0.55)
  - curvature: How rounded the bulb is (typical: 0.30-1.0)
  - asymmetry: Tilt direction (typical: -0.15 to 0.15)
  - corner_slope: Tangent angle at corners (typical: 0.00-0.25)
  - squareness: How flat/square the bulb top is (typical: 1.0-1.5)
  - neck_flare: Neck shape control (typical: -0.5 to 0.6)

  Current 6-Curve Structure per Tab/Blank Edge:
  - Curve 1: Flat edge entry (corner) → neck base left
  - Curve 2: Neck base left → bulb mid-left (waist)
  - Curve 3a: Bulb mid-left → bulb apex
  - Curve 3b: Bulb apex → bulb mid-right
  - Curve 5: Bulb mid-right → neck base right (waist)
  - Curve 6: Neck base right → flat edge exit (corner)

  Request for Visual Comparison

  We've attached comparison images showing our generated puzzle pieces next to reference pieces from real puzzles. Please analyze these images and tell us:

  1. Where do the two shapes differ the most visually?
  2. What areas of the puzzle piece outline look the least realistic compared to the reference?
  3. What would be the single most impactful area to improve to make our generated pieces look more like real puzzle pieces?

  Focus on describing the visual differences you observe rather than specific implementation details. We want to understand which aspects of the shape need the most attention.
